Known-Plaintext Attack
John used a known-plaintext attack because he had a piece of ciphertext ("CIW") and its corresponding plaintext
("yes"). By comparing these two, he was able to determine the encryption key.

Deciphering the Plaintext: "TREASUSE"
John discovered that the key was a left shift of 4. He applied this same shift to the new ciphertext "XVIEWYWI"
to find the plaintext.

X - 4 positions = T
V - 4 positions = R
I - 4 positions = E
E - 4 positions = A
W - 4 positions = S
Y - 4 positions = U
W - 4 positions = S
I - 4 positions = E

The decrypted plaintext is "TREASUSE"
